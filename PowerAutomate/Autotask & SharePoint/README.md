This is a series of Power Automate flows that I have created that integrates SharePoint Lists & Document Libaries with Autotask.

I will update this README over time with more details on the flows, but in the meantime feel free to download and import and then drop me a message on linkedin to go through it in detail of how it all works.

You will need to have admin access into Autotask, so that you can create an API service user.
